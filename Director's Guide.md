# Director's Guides

## Copyright

## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to provide some helpful hints and guidance to Race Directors when organising a paddle board event in Great Britain and the United Kingdom. It should be read along with the "Competition Rules" and the "Competitior Guide" documents for full context. The "Competition Rules" document is suggested as your next point of call after reading through this for the first time, hopefully having gained an initial overview of what tends to be involved.

This document is not intended to be overly perscriptive, you may not even be intending to run an event per say but might find some of the contents useful purely as a background to the current state of Paddle Boarding in Great Britain. The "Competition Rules" document is, on the other hand designed to be perscriptive and more instructional so as to provide a consistent, transparent and reasonably level playing field upon which we can establish a healthy and growing sport.

The "Competitior Guide" is a briefer "getting started", preperation type document intended to give first time pariticpants an idea of what to bring, where to start, what to expect and a rough idea of what order things to happen in at GB SUP events specifically, along with a minimum viable introduction to the rules.
