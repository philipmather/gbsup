## 1.2 Board Classes
The following definitions will be used to group boards into classes at all events, the definition of a board class doesn't imply it's representation or acceptance at a parituclar or indeed any race, nor does it prohibit classes being merged.

* 1.2.1 "One Design" classes are recognised as a fleet of boards produced to common criteria as defined by a board manufacturer.
* 1.2.2 "Surf Shape" or "SS" shall be any board 12 feet and 5 inches in length or less with a planning hull. Displament, semi-displacement or concave hulls are not permitted in this class.
* 1.2.3 "Twelve foot six" or "12'6" class is defined as any board equal to 12 feet and 6 inches in length or less when combined with a non-planning hull.
* 1.2.4 "Fourteen foot" or "14’0" class is defined as any board greater than 12 feet and 7 inches upto 14 feet in length.
* 1.2.5 "Unlimited" or "UL" class is any board longer than 14 feet and 1 inch.
* 1.2.6 "Mega Board" or "MB" class is any board designed to be paddled by more than 4 paddlers and whose width can accomodate two paddlers stood side-by-side.

## 1.3 Age Classes
The following Age Classes apply to all events:
* 15 - 17 refered to as "Juniors" *(15 upward is ICF)*  
* 18 - 39 refered to as "Seniors"
* 40 - 49 refered to as "Masters"
* 50 - 59 refered to as "Veterans"
* 60+ refered to as "Kahuna"

1.3.1 Racers will compete in the class that represents their age on the 1st of January in the year during which the race series starts.

1.3.2 At the Race Directors discretion junior paddlers only may elect to compete in only the Seniors category.

1.3.3 It is the Racers obligation to notify the Race Director at check-in that they wish to race outside their nominal age class, to ensure that they start in the correct start wave and to ensure that the points and prizes are attributed correctly afterward.

## 1.4 Equipment
* 1.4.1 "Paddle" is defined as a single bladed propulsion device with a handle on one end and blade on the other. A paddle that has more than one blade is illegal. Paddles may be adjustable.
* 1.4.2 "Fin" is a projecting surface or attachment for providing stability and preventing slippage only. It shall not be movable or pivitoable, provide any means of steering (thus becoming a rudder) nor provide lift (thus becoming a foil).
* 1.4.3 "Rudder" is a projecting surface or attachement hinged vertically or horizontally that provides any means of steering or controlling movement.
* 1.4.4 "Foil" is a projecting surface or attachement designed to produce any lift.
* 1.4.5 "Leash" is the safety device connecting the Racer to their Board. This is mandatory during all races, failure to use it will result in immediate disqualification. The leash must be mounted to a dedicated mounting point(s) and not ancillary points such has handles and belt loops. It is advised that it is mounted infront of the racer for visibility and the use of a waist mounted, quick-release style leash is strongly encouraged to mitigate the risk of entanglement.
* 1.4.6 "Bouyancy Aid" or "Personal Floatation Device" is the safety device

# 2. Restrictions
## 2.1 Board Restrictions
2.1.1 All boards, at rest and/or whilst being propelled, must have only one effective hull, no catamarans, outrigger floats (such as an ama), spars or other such devices. 

2.1.2 The length of a board will be measured as a straight line between any two points on the furthest extents (in the event of an horizontally asymetric design) of the board which produces the longest measurement, not the rocker, water or hull line. The points do not have to share a plane with any (horizontal, vertical or other) feature of the board.

2.1.3 It is at the descretion of the Race Director as to whether the unlimited board class may or may not run with rudders where fitted and whether those that have are then sperated into their own Board Class.

2.1.4 It is also at the Race Directors descretion as to whether a steering system can be suitably locked, disabled, removed or otherwise adjusted so as to comply with the other non-steerably classes.

2.1.5 It is at the discretion of the Race Director as to whether an event includes a seperate discipline for boards that can be fitted with foils and the layout of such a seperate course.

2.1.6 One Design boards may compete outside of their nominal One Design class at the Race Directors discretion and so long as they meet the other classes criteria.

2.1.7 It is the Racers obligation to notify the Race Director at check-in that they wish to race outside of their nominal One Design class, to ensure that they start in the correct start wave and to ensure that the points and prizes are attributed correctly afterward.

## 2.2 Competitor Restrctions

2.2.1 Stand up paddle boards shall be propelled by Racers using a single paddle, the inertia of their own body and harnessing the natural power of wind (excluding sails) and wave.

3.1.3 The Sprint specialisation series will be scored on the best three results of the Sprint Races (NWF, Winderemere and BaySUP).

3.1.4 The Technical specialisation series will be scored on best three results of the Technical Races (BaySUP, NWF(?), st Ives(?)).

## Safety
All Racers and Volunters in any events must wear a leash regardless of local marine laws. Failure to do so will result in immediate disqualification.

Bouyancy aids (BA) and other Personal Floatation Devices (PFD’s) can be worn if the Racer wishes to do so. The Race Director may add a PFD or BA to the racing requirement at their discretion on a per Racer basis or to the entire field.

During an event, a Racer or Volunteer who is distressed should wave their hands and/or paddle in a back-and-forth crossing motion above their heads. Competitors who see a Racer, Volunteer or any other person  in distress via the signal or other indication MUST provide assistance and/or help to gain the attention of the closest safety personnel or emergency service. If a paddler stops to assist those in distress they should highlight this to Race Director who will readdress your final time on an presumed-honesty basis.

## Racing Procedures

There must be at least three Racers in each Age, Board and Gender Class devision to form a podium and award prizes at individual races. If there are less than three Racers it is at the Race Directors discretion to merge Age, Board and/or Gender Classes together as they see fit to form as many podiums as is desired.

## Race Start
The race start shall be a single audible sound such as a whistle, single horn blast or starter gun accompanied with a visual signal such as a flag being raised, lowered or waved. Such indications should be chosen so as not to be confused with safety signals. The exact starting sequence and method of starting will be described in the Safety Briefing.

The race start shall be within 5 minutes of the published race start time. Prior to the race start the Starter shall bring the competitors to the start line no greater than 10 minutes and no less than 5 minutes before the first start.

The start sequence at all events will be 3 minute audible warning, followed 3 minutes later by a single audible warning, signaling the start.

Any competitor who does not follow the instructions of the Starter or who is ahead of the start line once the starting sequence has begun shall be given a false start and a penalty.

Race start sequences shall be as follows:

Naish N1SCO One Design
12’6 Ladies
12’6 Men
14’ Ladies
14’ Men
Surf Shape (if board class is included in race and their race distance is less than the full UK SUP
race distance. If the Surf Shape race distance is the same as the main race then it will be positioned with or before the Naish N1SCO class)
There shall be 3 minutes between each start to allow the next class to assemble for their start. The start of the previous class will be the 3 minute warning for the next class start.

#### Beach Starts
If flags are used for the line, Racers must align their body with the flags. Any Racer with their body completely in front of any start flag will be given a false start by the Race Committee and a penalty.

The Starter will record the name and number of the Racer and let them know they have a false start at the earliest possibility.

#### Straddled starts
In the event of particular high winds or choppy seas, racers may be asked to sit on their boards behind the start buoys.

#### Water Start
Competitors with their body in front of the buoys before the start horn sounds will be given a false start and a penalty.

If the Starter is not satisfied with the line once the competitors are called up, the command will be ‘STOP’ and competitors will begin the starting sequence again.

Racers will receive a false start if they are not present on the start line once the start sequence has begun for their heat and penalty. Starters shall not wait for any tardy Racer, no start will be delayed to wait for a Racer.

Alternative race starts may be made in the case of unique geography, race formats or conditions. All alternative starts must be approved by the Race Committee and covered in the pre-race briefing.

#### False Starts
A competitors first false start will receive a 2 minute time penalty. The start procedure will recommence and the 2 minute time penalty will be added to the paddler’s final timing once the start has been successful. On a competitors second false start infraction the competitor will be disqualified.

Racers must only react to the starting signal and must not try to anticipate the sound.

Racers must not make any forward racing strokes once called to the line and before the start.

#### Failure to Start or Finish
If a Racer does not start in an assigned heat for any reason other than sickness or injury, the Racer shall be disqualified from all events scheduled that day.

#### Re-Start
If there is outside interference or any other unforeseen circumstances, the Starter may recall all competitors with two long horn blasts. The Starter will begin a new starting sequence once all competitors are behind the start line.

## Finish
A competitor has finished a race when their body has crossed the line.

Racers must be in control and on their boards for at least three seconds after crossing the line in order to receive a valid Water Finish.

Racers must remain upright and standing for at least three seconds after crossing the line in order to be given a valid Beach Finish.

Racers must cross the line with their paddle in hand to recieve a valid finish.

Racers without their paddle or not in control must re-cross the finish line correctly to receive a valid finish. If the finish line is demarked by bouys or flags the Racer must treat the nearest marker as a bouy and pass clockwise or anti-clockwise around it as appropriate without impeding the finish of other Racers.

Racers must clear the finish line area as soon as they cross the line and not impeed the finish of other Racers, failure to do so may be deemed as an invalid finish.

The timekeepers will notify any competitors of infractions as soon as possible after they occur.

Invalid finishes may receive a time penalty, typically of 2 minutes but at the discretion of the Race Director.

## Paddling on the Course
A Racer will not be disqualified for touching a turn buoy, unless, in the opinion of the Race Director, an advantage has been gained. This may include picking up and moving the mark with hands or a paddle.

A Racer will have a penalty applied if they round a mark in the wrong direction on land or water.

If a Racer misses a mark or a lap completely they will be disqualified, the Racer has the option of correcting themselves by rounding the mark correctly without impeeding other Racers or completing missed laps.

All marks following a missed mark will also be deemed as missed and should hence be renegotiated in normal lap order.

Racers may deviate from the course, providing they make all of the marks and do not impede other Racers.

Racers shall not pass through any bridges, docks, tunnels, piers or other landmarks or structures that they are not explicitly required to pass through by the Race Director on the basis of safety.

Racers that take more than five consecutive paddle strokes on their knees may be disqualified.

## Drafting
Drafting is not allowed out of Board or Gender class as defined for the race.

A paddler will be deemed drafting when within 1 meter of the tail, or sides of another competitor or any water
craft on the racecourse for more than 10 seconds.

If the boundaries of a race course do not allow competitors to get outside of the drafting zone then no drafting rules will apply at that time.

A competitor must make an effort to exit the drafting zone immediately when boundaries, other craft or conditions allow. Examples of natural boundaries include rocks, canals, submerged objects, bridges and vessels.

Competitors will be disqualified for drafting any water craft on the race course that is not in the same Class.

No drafting of boats or other water craft at any time.

## Disqualification
Any Racer who attempts to win a race by any other than appropriate means, or who does not follow racing regulations, may be disqualified from the event.

Any Racers who behaves in an excessively aggressive way through their conduct or speech towards the competition officials, other Racers, sponsors or spectators, may be disqualified from the event.

A Racer shall not receive external assistance during a race from another Racer or non-Racer. A Racer providing the external assistance may also be disqualified from the race.

Any Racer that displays unethical conduct before, during or after an event may be disqualified.

Unethical or dishonarable conduct includes but is not limited to:

(a) excessive physical harm using any part of the body, paddle, board or other equipment;
(b) using the board, paddle or body in order to block a competitor from forward progress, turning, drafting, starting or finishing;
(c) yelling at the start in order to create a false start;
(d) purposely impeding the ability of a Racer to paddle, turn, dismount, start, finish or run.

The Race Director shall notify a disqualified Racer at the earliest possibility.

There shall be a zero tolerance to bullying, unehtical or dishonarable behavior on or off the water. If a Racer is found to bully or be act unethically or dishonarably to a fellow Racer, organizer or spectator they will risk disqualification from the race or series.

## Protest
A protest may be made only by a Racer at the event in question.

A protest must be filed with a member of the Competition Committee no later than 20 minutes after the Racer has finished a race or received a notice of disqualification.

When a protest is made against a Racer or Race Official, all parties in question shall be informed of the protest.

Protests will be decided upon by the Competition Committee through first-hand accounts as well as any photographic and/or video evidence.

## Prize Money
There will be no prize money awarded by GB SUP, trophies and medals will be awarded at each race.

## Registration
Registration will close at 22:00 on the Wednesday prior to the race.

It is at the Race Directors discretion to accept registrations after this time as the online process now handles bib number assignment and waiver sign off which significantly reduces the logistical complexity of running a race.

Any Racer not registering on time will not receive a race number. Some clubs may cap the entries for their race; therefore it is best to register early.

## GB SUP Membership
Every Racer must be a member of GB SUP, there is no cost for membership. Membership must be completed prior to the race and all members must sign membership form stating they have read, understood and will adhere to all rules.

## Special Notes
The Race Director's decision is final.

Junior age elevation.
Foiling boards.
Unlimited and steerable.
Visual and Audiable signals.

Paddlers may have formal or informal aggreements about drafting within their class.

A Racer drafting another, even for the entire race, only to pass at the last moment shall not ultimately be considered unethical but as a matter of tactics that should be countered.

The phrase "rubbing is racing" should be considered as a convention in regards to crowded bouy turns, more specficially for inflatable boards than the potentially more fragile carbon construction.

Repeated contact with the rear of another Racers board from behind whilst drafting may ultimately be considered as a lack of board control and hence be penalized.

Paddlers may carry only one spare paddle, this is only to be used in the event that their original fails under normal usage.

Paddlers may lend their spare paddle to others during the race, in doing so they do it without obligation even in the event that their original paddle then fails.

Paddlers may not lend any other other equipment, food, water, performance monitoring, navigation or repair equipment during a race unless it becomes a safety consideration.

## Technical considerations
There is no restriction on the size, shape or number of fins a board may or may not have.

## Adaptive Paddling
As discussed in the introduction, as the Race Director's descision is always final it is at their discretion to remove, ignore, adapt or modify, append or replace any rules included in this document or other conventions as maybe needed to encourange those of all abilities to take part so long as safety is maintained.

Specifically, the use of double ended paddles and requirements to take no more than five strokes whilst not standing should not stand as impediments.
