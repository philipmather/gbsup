# Paddler’s Rules

The Race Director's decision is final.

## People
* Racer
* Race Organiser
* Race Director
* Race Committee
* Time Keeper
* Starter
* Volunteer

## Board Classes
The following definitions will be used to group boards into classes at all UK SUP events, the definition of a board class doesn't imply it's representation or acceptance at a parituclar or indeed any race, nor does it prohibit classes being merged.

* "Surf Shape" or "SS" shall be any board 12 feet and 5 inches in length or less with a planning hull. Displament, semi-displacement or concave hulls or not permitted in this class.
* "Twelve foot six" or "12'6" class is defined as any board equal to 12 feet and 6 inches in length or less when combined with a non-planning hull.
* "Fourteen foot" or "‘14’0" class is defined as any board greater than 12 feet and 7 inches upto 14 feet in length.
* "Unlimited" or "UL" class is any board longer than 14 feet and 1 inch.
* "Mega Board" or "MB" class is any board designed to be paddled by more than 4 paddlers and whose width can accomodate two paddlers stood side-by-side.
* "One Design" classes are recognised as a fleet of boards produced to common criteria as defined by a board manufacturer.

The length of a board will be measured as a straight line between the two points producing the longest measurement along the board, as opposed to the rocker or hull line.

One Design boards may compete outside of their nominal One Design class at the race directors discretion and so long as they meet the other classes criteria. It is the Racers obligation to notify the Race Director at check-in that they wish to race outside their nominal One Design class, to ensure that they start in the correct start wave and to ensure that the points and prizes are attributed correctly afterward.

## Age Classes
UK SUP comprises the following age classes:

* -17 and below refered to as "Juniors".
* 18 - 39 refered to as "Seniors"
* 40 - 49 refered to as "Masters"
* 50 - 59 refered to as "Veterans"
* 60+ refered to as "Super Veterans"

Racers will compete in the group that represents your age on the 31st of December in the year the race series starts.

At the Race Directors discretion those paddlers aged 16 and 17 may elect to compete in the Seniors category. It is the Racers obligation to notify the Race Director at check-in that they wish to race outside their nominal age class, to ensure that they start in the correct start wave and to ensure that the points and prizes are attributed correctly afterward.

## National Race Series
There will be 5 races in the 2017 UK SUP race series, competitors best 3 results will count towards their
overall score.

There must be at least 3 racers in any age group and board class to qualify for age group podium at individual
races. If there are less than 3 racers the Race Director may merge board classes together within an age class to ensure a
podium finish in as many classes as feasible.

Each competitor must have completed at least 3 races within the series to be eligible for the final age group
podium.

## Equipment
* "Paddle" is defined as a single bladed propulsion device with a handle on one end and blade on the other. A
paddle that has more than one blade is not legal.

* "Leash", is the safety device connecting the Racer to their Board. This is mandatory during all races, failure to use it will result in immediate disqualification. The leash must be mounted to dedicated mounting points and not ancillary points such has handles and belt loops. The use of a waist mounted, quick-release style coiled leash is strongly encouraged.

* "Bouyancy Aid" or "Personal Floatation Device",

## Safety
All competitors in any UK SUP events must wear a leash regardless of local marine laws. Failure to do so will result in immediate disqualification.

Bouyancy aids (BA) and other Personal Floatation Devices (PFD’s) can be worn if the Racer wishes to do so. The Race Director may add a PFD or BA to the racing requirement at their discretion.

During an event, a paddler who is distressed should wave their hands or paddle in a back-and-forth motion above their heads.
Competitors who see another paddler in distress should assist the paddler and help to gain the attention of the closest safety personnel. If a paddler stops to assist a paddler in distress please highlight to Race Director to readdress your final time.

## Racing Procedures
### Race Start
The race start shall be a single audible sound such as a single horn blast or starter gun. The exact starting
sequence and method of starting will be described in the Pre-race briefing.

The race start shall start within 5 minutes of the published race start time.
Prior to the race start the Starter shall bring the competitors to the start line no greater than 10 minutes and no
less than 5 minutes before the first start.

The start sequence at all UK SUP events will be 3 minute audible warning, followed 3 minutes later by a single
audible warning, signaling the start.

Any competitor who does not follow the instructions of the Starter or who is ahead of the start line once the
starting sequence has begun shall be given a false start and a 2 minute penalty.
Race start sequences shall be as follows:

Naish N1SCO One Design
12’6 Ladies
14’ Ladies
12’6 Men
14’ Men
Surf Shape (if board class is included in race and their race distance is less than the full UK SUP
race distance. If the Surf Shape race distance is the same as the main race then it will be positioned inbetween
the Naish N1SCO and 12’6’ Ladies classes)
There shall be 3 minutes between each start to allow the next class to assemble for their start. The start of the
previous class will be the 3 minute warning for the next class start.

#### Beach Starts
If flags are used for the line, competitors must align their body with the flags.
Any competitor with their body completely in front of any start flag will be given a false start by the Race
Committee and a 2 minute time penalty.

The Starter will record the name and number of the competitor and let them know they have a false start at the
earliest possibility.

#### Straddled starts
In the event of high winds or choppy seas, racers may be asked to sit on their boards behind the start buoys.

#### Water Start
Competitors with their body in front of the buoys before the start horn sounds will be given a false start and a 2
minute time penalty.

If the Starter is not satisfied with the line once the competitors are called up, the command will be ‘STOP’ and
competitors will begin the starting sequence again.

Competitors will receive a false start if they are not present on the start line once the start sequence has begun
for their heat and a 2 minute time penalty. Starters shall not wait for any tardy paddlers. No start will be delayed to wait for a paddler.

Alternative race starts may be made in the case of unique geography, race formats or conditions. All alternative
starts must be approved by the race committee and covered in the pre-race briefing.

#### False Starts
A competitors first false start will receive a 2 minute time penalty. The start procedure will recommence and the
2 minute time penalty will be added to the paddler’s final timing once the start has been successful.
On a competitors second false start infraction the competitor will be disqualified.

Racers must only react to the starting signal and must not try to anticipate the sound.

Racers must not make any forward racing strokes once called to the line and before the start.

#### Failure to Start or Finish
If a competitor does not start in an assigned heat for any reason other than sickness or injury, the competitor
shall be disqualified from all events scheduled that day.

#### Re-Start
If there is outside interference or any other unforeseen circumstances, the Starter may recall all competitors with
two long horn blasts. The Starter will begin a new starting sequence once all competitors are behind the start
line.

## Finish
A competitor has finished a race when their body has crossed the line.

Racers must be in control and on their boards for at least three seconds after crossing the line in order to receive a valid Water Finish.

Racers must remain upright and standing for at least three seconds after crossing the line in order to be given a valid Beach Finish.

Racers must cross the line with their paddle in hand to recieve a valid finish.

Racers without their paddle or not in control must re-cross the finish line correctly to receive a valid finish. If the finish line is demarked by bouys or flags the Racer must treat the nearest marker as a bouy and pass clockwise or anti-clockwise around it as appropriate without impeding the finish of other racers.

Racers must clear the finish line area as soon as they cross the line and not impeed the finish of other Racers, failure to do so may be deemed as an invalid finish.

The timekeepers will notify any competitors of infractions as soon as possible after they occur.

Invalid finishes may receive a time penalty, typically of 2 minutes but at the discretion of the Race Director.

## Drafting
Drafting is not allowed out of board class or gender defined for the race.

A paddler will be deemed drafting when within 1 meter of the tail, or sides of another competitor or any water
craft on the racecourse for more than 10 seconds.

If the boundaries of a race course do not allow competitors to get outside of the drafting zone then no drafting
rules will apply at that time.

A competitor must make an effort to exit the drafting zone immediately when boundaries allow. Examples of
natural boundaries include rocks, canals, submerged objects, bridges and vessels.

Competitors will be disqualified for drafting any water craft on the race course that is not in the same class or
gender.

No drafting of boats or other water craft at any time.

## Paddling on the Course
A competitor will not be disqualified for touching a turn buoy, unless, in the opinion of the Race Director, an
advantage has been gained. This may include picking up and moving the mark with hands or a paddle.

A competitor will have a time penalty if they round a buoy or gate in the wrong direction.

If a paddler misses a buoy or a lap completely they will be disqualified, the paddler has the option of correcting themselves by rounding the bouy correctly without impeeding other racers or completing missed laps.

Competitors may deviate from the course, providing they make all of the marks and do not impede other competitors.

Competitors shall not pass through any bridges, docks, tunnels, piers or other landmarks that they are not explicitly required to pass through by the Race Director.

Competitors that take more than five consecutive paddle strokes from their knees may be disqualified.

Stand up paddle boards shall be propelled only by means of human-powered, single-bladed paddles.

## Disqualification
Any competitor who attempts to win a race by any other than appropriate means, or who does not follow racing regulations, may be disqualified from the event.

Any competitor who behaves in an excessively aggressive way through their conduct or speech towards the competition officials, other competitors, sponsors or spectators, may be disqualified from the event.

A competitor shall not receive external assistance during a race from another competitor or non-competitor. A competitor providing the external assistance may also be disqualified from the race. Any competitor that displays unsportsmanlike conduct before, during or after an event may be disqualified.

Unsportsmanlike conduct includes and is not limited to:

(a) excessive physical harm using any part of the body, paddle, board or other equipment;
(b) using the board, paddle or body in order to block a competitor from forward progress, turning, drafting, starting or finishing;
(c) yelling at the start in order to create a false start;
(d) purposely impeding the ability of a competitor to paddle, turn, dismount, start, finish or run.

The Race Director shall notify a disqualified competitor at the earliest possibility.

UK SUP has ZERO tolerance to bullying and unsporting behavior on or off the water. If a paddler is found to bully or be unsporting to a fellow paddler, organizer or spectator they will risk disqualification from the race or series.

## Protest
A protest may be made only by a Racer in the event in question.

A protest must be filed with a member of the Competition Committee no later than 20 minutes after the
competitor has finished a race or received a notice of disqualification.

When a protest is made against a competitor or Race Official, all parties in question shall be informed of the
protest.

Protests will be decided upon by the Competition Committee through first-hand accounts as well as any
photographic and video evidence.

## Prize Money
There will be no prize money in the National Race Series. UK SUP will award trophies and medals at each race.

## Registration
Registration will close at 22:00 on the Wednesday prior to the race.

It is at the Race Directors discretion to accept registrations after this time as the online process now handles bib number assignment and waiver sign off which significantly reduces the logistical complexity of running a race.

Any paddler not registering on time will not receive a race number. Some Clubs may cap the entries for their race; therefore it is best to register early.

## Entry to Board Class
Paddlers can only enter one race at any event. No paddler to enter both 12’6 and 14’ board class.

## UK SUP Membership
Every paddler must be a member of UK SUP, there is no cost for membership. Membership must be completed prior to the race and all members must sign membership form stating they have read, understood and will adhere to all rules. Membership forms will be available at all races during registration.
