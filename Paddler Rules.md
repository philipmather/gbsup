# Paddler’s Rules

The Race Director's decision is final.

## Defintion of roles
* Racer
* Race Organiser
* Race Director
* Race Committee
* Race Volunteer

## Board Classes
The following definitions will be used to group boards into classes at all UK SUP events, the definition of a board class doesn't imply it's representation or acceptance at a parituclar or indeed any race, nor does it prohibit classes being merged.

* "Surf Shape" or "SS" shall be any board 12 feet and 5 inches in length or less with a planning hull. Displament, semi-displacement or concave hulls or not permitted in this class.
* "Twelve foot six" or "12'6" class is defined as any board equal to 12 feet and 6 inches in length or less when combined with a non-planning hull.
* "Fourteen foot" or "‘14’0" class is defined as any board greater than 12 feet and 7 inches upto 14 feet in length.
* "Unlimited" or "UL" class is any board longer than 14 feet and 1 inch.
* "Mega Board" or "MB" class is any board designed to be paddled by more than 4 paddlers and whose width can accomodate two paddlers stood side-by-side.
* "One Design" classes are recognised as a fleet of boards produced to common criteria as defined by a board manufacturer.

The length of a board will be measured as a straight line between the two points producing the longest measurement along the board, as opposed to the rocker or hull line.

One Design boards may compete outside of their nominal One Design class at the race directors discretion and so long as they meet the other classes criteria. It is the Racers obligation to notify the Race Director at check-in that they wish to race outside their nominal One Design class, to ensure that they start in the correct start wave and to ensure that the points and prizes are attributed correctly afterward.

## Age Classes
UK SUP comprises the following age classes:

* -17 and below refered to as "Juniors".
* 18 - 39 refered to as "Seniors"
* 40 - 49 refered to as "Masters"
* 50 - 59 refered to as "Veterans"
* 60+ refered to as "Super Veterans"

Racers will compete in the group that represents your age on the 31st of December in the year the race series starts.

At the Race Directors discretion those paddlers aged 16 and 17 may elect to compete in the Seniors category. It is the Racers obligation to notify the Race Director at check-in that they wish to race outside their nominal age class, to ensure that they start in the correct start wave and to ensure that the points and prizes are attributed correctly afterward.

## Equipment
* "Paddle" is defined as a single bladed propulsion device with a handle on one end and blade on the other. A
paddle that has more than one blade is not legal.
* "Leash"
* "Bouyancy Aid" or "Personal Floatation Device",


National Race Series

There will be 5 races in the 2017 UK SUP race series, your competitors best 3 results will count towards your
overall score.


There must be at least 3 racers in any age group and board class to qualify for age group podium at individual
races. If there are less than 3 racers UK SUP will group board classes together in that age group to ensure a
podium finish in each age group.
Each competitor must have completed at least 3 races within the series to be eligible for the final age group
podium.

Safety
All competitors in UK SUP events must wear a leash regardless of local marine laws. In addition to the
mandatory leash, Bouyancy aids (BA) and other Personal Floatation Devices (PFD’s) can also be worn if the
racer wishes to do so. UK SUP reserves the right to add these to the racing requirement if it feels necessary.
During an event, a paddler who is distressed should wave their hands or paddle in a back-and- forth motion
above their heads.
Competitors who see another paddler in distress should assist the paddler and help to gain the attention of the
closest safety personnel. If a paddler stops to assist a paddler in distress please highlight to Race Director to
readdress your final time.
